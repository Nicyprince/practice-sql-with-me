# 📘 SQL Learning Journey – `store_db`

Welcome to my SQL learning journey! 🚀  
This repository documents my daily SQL practice using a custom fictional database: **`store_db`** — designed to simulate a retail business.

---

## 📦 What’s Inside

- A fully structured SQL database (`store_db`)
- Daily SQL exercises with:
  - 📄 Question-only files for self-practice
  - ✅ Answer files with solutions and comments
- Beginner to advanced topics (updated regularly)

---

## 🧑‍💻 How You Can Follow Along

Want to learn SQL with me? Here's how you can set it up on your own system:

### ✅ Step 1: Install MySQL

Install the following:

- [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
- MySQL Workbench

---

### ✅ Step 2: Create the Database

Open your SQL terminal or GUI tool and run:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE store_db;
USE store_db;
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Load the Tables and Sample Data

1. Go to the `database/` folder in this repo.
2. Copy and run the contents of:
   - `schema.sql` – creates all the necessary tables
   - `sample_data.sql` – inserts sample data into those tables

Now you're ready to start writing queries using real data!
